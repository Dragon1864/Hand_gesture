# Hand_gesture
detecting static hand gesture without using camera module
This a device which predicts static hand gestures using four IR sesnors whcih are placed like a square. 
Top Left              Top Right
Bottom Left           Bottom Right

and using if-esle if  conditions in embedded C we can identify the gestures. 
also added few lines to store the sequence in which the sensor is activated to predict the clockwise and anticlockwise motion.

It uses ESP-32 as the microcontroller here.
